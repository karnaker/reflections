When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To facilitate collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To give you better control over commits and the state of the local
    repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: make a clone directly on GitHub. Unlike a local clone, a fork
    includes references back to the original repository.

    Clone: copy a local or remote repository. Does not include references back
    to the original repository.

    Branch: Allows you to do some new work (a new feature, attempt to fix a
    bug, etc.) and keep your projects organized, while always maintaining a
    working master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Any future changes (either local or remote) will now have a common commit
    point.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You could use other file sharing services to collaborate. It may be easier
    for everyone to see and access files, but more difficult to control changes
    and really understand how a programming project is evolving.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
